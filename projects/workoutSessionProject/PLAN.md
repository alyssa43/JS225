**Practice Project: Workout Session Manager**

You’re building a system to track workout sessions. The system has three main components:
- WorkoutSession
- WorkoutSessionManager
- GoalWorkoutSessionManager

The goals of this project are to:
- Practice working on a larger codebase.
- Practice implementing functionality based on requirements.
- Practice writing tests that verify each requirement is met.
- Make reasonable assumptions as you go and document them clearly (without contradicting requirements).

===Part 1: WorkoutSession===

Create a `WorkoutSession` class:
- Represents a single workout session record.
- Has an id, duration, date, and activity.
- The date cannot be in the future.
- The duration must be a positive number.
- The activity must be a non-empty string.
- `WorkoutSession` objects are immutable once created.

**Assumptions & Decisions**
- A valid and unique `id` generated by `WorkoutSessionManager` will be passed in upon instantiation
- A session `duration` will be measured in minutes
- A session `date` will be passed in as a string representation of a date
- A session `date` will be stored as a `Date` object
- When determining if a `date` is in the future, dates will be interpreted as full datetime. If the input `date` is later than the current datetime it will be considered in the future.
- A session `activity` will be stored as all lowercase characters
- `duration`, `date`, and `activity` will all be validated and/or normalized through static methods in the `WorkoutSession` class

===Part 2: WorkoutSessionManager (Basic)===

- Create a `WorkoutSessionManager` class with basic functionality:
- Manages a collection of `WorkoutSession` objects.
- Supports operations to:
  - Add a new workout session.
  - Remove a session by id.
  - Add a new allowed activity.
  - Retrieve the current list of allowed activities.
- Instances should start with a default set of allowed activities:
  - Running, Strength, Cycling, Yoga, Swimming
- Enforces that all workout sessions belong to an allowed activity.

**Assumptions & Decision**
- Collection of `WorkoutSession` objects will be stored in an array
- Activities can be any non-empty string

===Part 3: WorkoutSessionManager (Extended)===

Extend the functionality of WorkoutSessionManager:
- Summarize sessions:
  - total minutes
  - average duration
  - count of sessions
- Filter sessions by a date range (inclusive).
- Filter sessions by activity.

**Assumptions & Decisions**
- Session summary will be an object with 3 properties:
  - totalMinutes
  - averageDuration
  - sessionCount
- Filtering sessions by date range will take a startDate and endDate
- Date range must be passed in as valid string representation of dates

===Part 4: GoalWorkoutSessionManager===

Create a `GoalWorkoutSessionManager` class that provides similar behavior to `WorkoutSessionManager` but includes a weekly minutes goal.
- Includes a `weeklyGoal` value` (positive number).
- Prevents adding sessions that would cause the total minutes to exceed the goal.
- Provides a way to show how many minutes remain before hitting the weekly goal.
- Summary also reports:
  - goal minutes
  - remaining minutes

**Assumptions & Decisions**
- `GoalWorkoutSessionManager` will be a subclass of `WorkoutSessionManager`

**General Guidelines**
- Maintain encapsulation. Expose only what’s necessary through public methods.
- Use defensive copies when returning collections or objects to prevent unintended external modifications.
- Write tests to verify that each class and method meets its stated requirements (including error cases and boundary cases like empty manager and inclusive date ranges).
